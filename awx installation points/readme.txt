for beginners use the inventory file in the following URL
https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/ansible/awx/5360/556020532

if you get docker and docker-py both should not exist. then uninstall both of them and install only one of them again.

Ensure that the port (given in the inventory file) is not already being used by any other service.
